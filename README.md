I have developed a simple project with the purpose of adding Jest-RTL testing to my skillset.  

# Assignment:

## For the following files, write tests to ensure that: 

### SummaryForm.js 

- Checkbox is unchecked by default
- Checking checkbox enables button
- Unchecking checkbox again disables button
- Terms popover isn't in the DOM at render
- Terms popover is visible when hovering over text "terms and conditions"
